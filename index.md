# Alex's First CS193 Homework

Favorite things about the class:
- improve knowledge about familiar tools
- content is interesting and I enjoy learning it
- relaxed environment
- during last lecture, they played a fun game...
  - where I managed to remain standing for the entire time. including the last question about being in love. I am, actually, for my girlfriend Kayden. her response to me telling this story: "IM SOBFIDODNDBDJ"

for anything remotely about me, I feel the urge to mention that I have four cats. they are on my mind very much. I wish they could be here too.
